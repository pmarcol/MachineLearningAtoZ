# MachineLearningAtoZ
Workspace for Udemy's 'Machine Learning A-Z' course.
See: https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/

I worked along with the course's teachers, I also experimented as the code was written (and then cleaned the code),
so files don't differ much from what can be downloaded from the author's source page.
